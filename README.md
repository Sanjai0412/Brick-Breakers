## 🧠 Gameplay Mechanics

- Ball bounces off walls, paddle, and bricks.
- When the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.
- Destroy all bricks to win!
- Score increases over time while the ball is in play.
- **High score is saved locally** using `localStorage`.

## 🧩 Special Feature: Paddle-Based Directional Control

- The paddle is divided into **three regions**:
  - **Left third**: Makes the ball bounce left faster.
  - **Center third**: Produces a slight random angle.
  - **Right third**: Makes the ball bounce right faster.
- This clever use of paddle regions creates a **realistic ball deflection** and speed variation effect — giving players more control over the game.
